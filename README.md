# miniRT
# DESCRIPTION:
The goal here is to display different shapes of objects (here sphere, plans, cylinder) with the graphical engine MLX (a basic graphical engin for student) using ray-tracing. It has to have 'dynamic' shadows and lights (meaning that you can set the scene however you want, not that it runs smoothly when changing), color and a 'moving' camera.

# How to use
On a clean Ubuntu, I am not sure on how to make the graphical engine (MLX) works.
sudo apt install libx11-dev
sudo apt install libxext-dev

and now something something about a bsd library.
